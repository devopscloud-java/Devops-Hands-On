Git Operations Task
ðŸ“˜ Objective

This task demonstrates the basic Git operations â€” creating a repository, staging files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub.

ðŸ§© Steps Performed
1. Create a new folder
mkdir GitTask
cd GitTask

2. Create the required files
echo "This is the code file" > Code.txt
echo "This is the log file" > Log.txt
echo "This is the output file" > Output.txt

3. Initialize a new Git repository
git init

4. Stage the required files

Only Code.txt and Output.txt need to be staged.

git add Code.txt Output.txt

5. Commit the staged files
git commit -m "Added Code.txt and Output.txt files"

6. Connect to GitHub repository

(Replace <your-repo-url> with your actual GitHub repository link)

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

7. Push the committed files to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

âœ… Files in the Folder

Code.txt

Log.txt

Output.txt

ðŸ§  Notes

git status can be used anytime to check which files are staged or untracked.

Ensure you have set your GitHub credentials using:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
